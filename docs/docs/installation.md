# Installation

**Hedera Wallet Connect** is a library that enables decentralized applications (dApps) to interact seamlessly with Hedera wallets using the WalletConnect protocol. This integration facilitates secure and efficient communication between your dApp and Hedera-based wallets.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating Hedera Wallet Connect into your project, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js**: Version 18.0 or above. Use NVM to manage Node.js versions. [Install NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) and then run the following commands:
  ```bash
  nvm install 18
  nvm use 18
  ```
- **Package Manager**: npm or yarn. After installing Node.js, npm is included by default. To install Yarn, run:
  ```bash
  npm install --global yarn
  ```
- **WalletConnect Cloud Project ID**: Required for establishing connections between your dApp and wallets.
  1. Visit [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com)
  2. Sign in or create a new account
  3. Click "Create New Project"
  4. Name your project and click "Create"
  5. Copy the "Project ID" from the project dashboard

## Installation

Install the Hedera Wallet Connect package using npm or yarn. Note, you will also need to install the Hedera SDK and other peer dependencies.

### Using npm

```bash
npm install @hashgraph/hedera-wallet-connect @hashgraph/sdk @hashgraph/proto @hashgraph/hedera-wallet-connect @walletconnect/modal @walletconnect/qrcode-modal @walletconnect/utils  @walletconnect/modal-core
```

### Using yarn

```bash
yarn add @hashgraph/hedera-wallet-connect @hashgraph/sdk @hashgraph/proto @hashgraph/hedera-wallet-connect @walletconnect/modal @walletconnect/qrcode-modal @walletconnect/utils  @walletconnect/modal-core
```

## React Native Compatibility

React Native is based on [JavaScriptCore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore) (part of WebKit) and does not use Node.js or the common Web and DOM APIs. As such, there are many operations missing that a normal web environment or Node.js instance would provide.

For this reason, the additional packages polyfil and shim must be installed to ensure compatibility with hedera-wallet-connect, @hashgraph/sdk and other dependencies:

### Using npm

```bash
npm install @walletconnect/react-native-compat react-native-polyfill-globals @ethersproject/shims
```

### Using yarn

```bash
yarn add @walletconnect/react-native-compat react-native-polyfill-globals @ethersproject/shims
```

### Setup shims and polyfills

Create a polyfills.js file with the following contents:

```js
import "@ethersproject/shims";
import '@walletconnect/react-native-compat';
import { polyfill } from 'react-native-polyfill-globals/src/encoding';

polyfill();

// mock for matchMedia in @walletconnect/modal-core
window.matchMedia = window.matchMedia || (function () {
    return {
        matches: true,
        addListener: function () { },
        removeListener: function () { }
    };
});
```

And connect it as early as possible before importing hedera-wallet-connect, for example in global _layout.jsx:
```js
import "polyfills.js";
...
import { Wallet } from "@hashgraph/hedera-wallet-connect";

export default function RootLayout() {
  ...
}
```
